        <p>
          I&apos;m passionate about creating scalable, maintainable software solutions that solve real-world problems.
          My journey in technology began with a curiosity about how things work, which evolved into a deep
          appreciation for clean code, thoughtful architecture, and user-centered design.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a Full-Stack Product Engineer, I bridge the gap between technical implementation and business value.
          I believe that the best software is not just technically sound, but also intuitive, accessible,
          and truly useful to the people who use it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in modern web technologies and understand the importance of simplicity - both in code
          and in user experience. Every line of code I write is guided by principles of maintainability,
          scalability, and performance.
